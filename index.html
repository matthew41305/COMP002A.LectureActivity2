        <h2>The Forgetten Story</h2>

        <p>In a galaxy far, far away, a brave chicken nugget named Nuggetron discovered his superpowers during an epic battle against the Evil Fry Lords.
             With the ability to fly and shoot BBQ sauce blasts, he soared through the cosmos, rallying fellow food heroes.
              Nuggetron teamed up with Captain Ketchup and Princess Peppers to save the Galactic Diner from being overcooked.
               Together, they flipped the fate of the galaxy, proving that even the smallest nugget can make a huge difference!</p>
